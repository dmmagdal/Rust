# Guessing Game Notes

 - Most of the actual notes for the game are found as comments in the numbered `main*.rs` files (ie `main1.rs`, `main2.rs`, ...).
     - The "final" copy of the guessing game with abbreviated comments can be found in `main.rs`.
         - This final copy can be built/run with the same `cargo` commands from before.
 - The guessing game is a project from Chapter 2 of the rust book.
